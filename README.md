## Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adrian
I study Business and Information Technology and I am a full stack developer

### Background
I started coding back in 2015, practice with Visual Studio, on small projects/games, as I was interested
in how computer programs/games were made. I also made my own blog, and I experimented
with some HTML. After all of this, one of my favourite games, Minecraft, had Servers -- which inspired me
to work on my own! And now, I am a full-stack developer.

By making different projects throughout the years, it has taught me different skills and abilities, such as
working on my own, working within teams, making businesses and advertising and marketing, social skills, 
and learning git, linux, sql, and other kinds of applications and software which has further improved me as a person.

### Languages
PHP, JS, CSS, HTML, Python, Java, Kotlin
